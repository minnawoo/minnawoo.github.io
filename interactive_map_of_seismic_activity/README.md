### Level 1: Basic Visualization

Visualize an earthquake data set

1. **Get data set**

   ![data](Images/data.png)

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes ([USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)).

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the past seven days.

   * Reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in marker size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Create a legend for the marker colors.

### Level 2: More Data (Optional)

Pull in a second data set and visualize it along side the original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out earthquakes and fault lines so that they can be turned on and off independently.
